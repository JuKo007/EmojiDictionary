# Emoji Dictionary

This repo contains a function to scrape a dictionary of Emojis including a brief textual description and their byte representation.
It also contains the dictionary itself (21.02.2019). Upon running the function, data is scraped from [https://emojipedia.org/](https://emojipedia.org/).
As long as the urls for the repective Emoji categories and the XML paths to the respective lists stay the same, the function should be able to scrape and parse
the website also at later time, when more emojis mightÂ´ve been added (untested as of now).
